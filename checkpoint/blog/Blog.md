# DO YOU KNOW THE ROOT SOURCE OF PROGRAMMING??

## Introduction.

I know everyone has happen to have crossed paths with one of the fundamental yet complicate subject in the planet, Maths.
Mathematics is the basic study of numbers and their manipulation to perform computation. But the shocking part is even though we are not the Einstein's of our generation, we use math on a normal basis without knowing and I don't mean the normal exchage of money but the programs and technology we use on a daily basis.

The logic and structure of mordern programming languages stem from the basic arithmetic, algebra and logical reasoning found in mathematics. Some examples which are well known include subtraction and addition where multiplication and division were develop through bitwise shifting, to the most used control flows in programming(if-else and loops)

Yeah I know this might be a lot of information to take in but here are some images and site to get more infor on this.

` remember to add images on how binary shifting works for division and multiplications, also add  loop images and sites to learn about loops(geeksforgeeks)`


## In the Beginning...
In the 1930s, mathematicians were faced with the limits of what could be computed especially in set theory and logic. One of the pressing problems was how to formally define what it means for a problem to be solvable by a machine which made the situation dier with introduction of early computing machines since they needed a solid theoretical foundation to understand their capabilities.

One of those mathematicians was Alan Turing who is famously known for Turing Machines. Alan Turing was one of the founders of early computer programming where he proposed a concept of Turing Machine (an abstract computational model that could simulate any algorithmic process) to determine the truth or falsity of any given mathematical statement. In laymab's language if a mathematical statement is true or false.

This theoretcal model was designed to explore th boundaries of computation and solve problems related to algorithmis processes, and stil remains as a fundamental to computer science and programming theory.

Alan Turing was just one of the many mathematicians who helped to come up with some of the basics in mathematical logic and turing completeness. Another interesting mathematician was Alonzo Church who is famously known for Lambda Calculus. Yeah, yeah. I know it reminds you of your maths teacher trying to make you understand calculus but Lambda Calculus was used to
